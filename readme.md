# Mars Rover

This project involves the design and development of a Mars Rover prototype from the ground up. The primary objective is to replicate the fundamental capabilities of NASA-style rovers.The rover is being built to demonstrate essential planetary exploration functions such as all-terrain mobility, real-time obstacle avoidance, wireless/manual control, and potential for semi-autonomous behavior using onboard sensors.

## üîç Subsystems
- **Chassis & Mobility**: The mechanical design follows a six-wheeled rocker-bogie suspension system, inspired by NASA‚Äôs Mars Exploration Rovers (MER). This configuration ensures that the rover maintains maximum wheel contact on uneven terrain, allowing it to passively distribute weight and maintain stability.
- **Microcontroller**: We utilize the ESP32 DevKit as the main computational and control unit. It offers dual-core processing, built-in WiFi/Bluetooth, and ample GPIO support ‚Äî ideal for multitasking across sensors, motor drivers, and communication modules.



# Mechanical Design

The structural frame is composed primarily of aluminum extrusion profiles, joined with custom-designed acrylic brackets and waterjet aluminum plates for motor mounts and linkages.

- CAD: Designed in Fusion 360
- Materials: Aluminum Extrusion, Aluminium sheet, Acrylic
- Assembly: M3 screws, nuts, ball bearings, Ball & sockets joints
